#### Without Redis (Basic Mode):
```sh
docker run -d -p 5001:5001 --name neon-pulse sohelqt8797/ec2-neon-pulse:latest
```

#### With Redis (Recommended for better performance tracking):
```sh
docker network create neon-net

docker run -d --name redis-server --network=neon-net redis:alpine

docker run -d -p 5001:5001 --name neon-pulse --network=neon-net \
  -e REDIS_HOST=redis-server sohelqt8797/ec2-neon-pulse:latest
```

### 3. Access the Dashboard
Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5001/
```
